Built a Bar Code scanning Robot with the help of LEGO Mindstorms EV3 set that could read an encoded Barcode, decode the barcode and display and speak out the final result. It had built in functionality for scrolling through the bar-code sheet as well as scanning each individual bar-code precisely. The codes were encoded using Hamming Code logic and we used Stack Machine to execute the instruction/operand or Character given in the bar-code. Gitlab was used for version control along with Python as the Programming language.
